## Data Description

The "World Export & Import Dataset (1989 - 2023)" is a comprehensive collection of data related to international trade and trade policies. This dataset is designed to provide insights and analysis for researchers, policymakers, and analysts interested in understanding global trade dynamics. It covers various aspects of trade, including trade values, tariff rates, and trade policy indicators for numerous countries over multiple years.

### Data Fields:

- **Partner Name:** This feature represents the name of the trading partner or country with which import and export data is being measured. In your Kaggle dataset, you would create a column for "Partner Name" and include the names of countries or trading partners in this column.

- **Year:** This feature specifies the specific year for which the import and export data is recorded. In your Kaggle dataset, you would create a column for "Year" and include the respective year for each data entry.

- **Export (US$ Thousand):** This feature represents the total value of goods and products exported by the country in thousands of US dollars. In your dataset, you would create a column for "Export (US$ Thousand)" and include the export values in this format.

- **Import (US$ Thousand):** Similar to exports, this feature represents the total value of goods and products imported by the country in thousands of US dollars. Create a column for "Import (US$ Thousand)" to include import values in this format.

- **Export Product Share (%):** This feature indicates the percentage of the country's total exports that a specific product category represents. You can create a column for "Export Product Share (%)" and include the percentage values.

- **Import Product Share (%):** Like export product share, this feature represents the percentage of the country's total imports that a specific product category represents. Create a column for "Import Product Share (%)" to include these percentages.

- **Revealed Comparative Advantage:** This feature is likely a qualitative measure of whether a country has a comparative advantage in a particular product category. You can create a column for "Revealed Comparative Advantage" and provide values or rankings to denote this advantage.

- **World Growth (%):** This feature indicates the percentage change in the total value of world trade (exports and imports) compared to the previous year. Create a column for "World Growth (%)" and include the growth percentages.

- **Country Growth (%):** Similar to world growth, this feature represents the percentage change in the total value of a country's trade (exports and imports) compared to the previous year. Create a column for "Country Growth (%)" to include these percentages.

- **AHS Simple Average (%):** This feature likely refers to the simple average tariff rate applied by the country based on the Harmonized System (AHS) classification of products. Create a column for "AHS Simple Average (%)" to include these tariff rates as percentages.

- **AHS Weighted Average (%):** This feature represents the weighted average tariff rate applied by the country based on the Harmonized System (AHS) classification of products. Create a column for "AHS Weighted Average (%)" to include these tariff rates as percentages.

- **AHS Total Tariff Lines:** This feature indicates the total number of tariff lines or product categories in the Harmonized System. Create a column for "AHS Total Tariff Lines" and include the numerical count.

- **AHS Dutiable Tariff Lines Share (%):** This feature shows the percentage of tariff lines for which duties are applied. Create a column for "AHS Dutiable Tariff Lines Share (%)" and include the percentages.

- **AHS Duty Free Tariff Lines Share (%):** Similar to the previous feature, this one represents the percentage of tariff lines for which no duties are applied. Create a column for "AHS Duty Free Tariff Lines Share (%)" and include the percentages.

- **AHS Specific Tariff Lines Share (%):** This feature indicates the percentage of tariff lines with specific (fixed) duty rates. Create a column for "AHS Specific Tariff Lines Share (%)" and include the percentages.

- **AHS AVE Tariff Lines Share (%):** This feature represents the percentage of tariff lines with ad valorem equivalent (AVE) duty rates. Create a column for "AHS AVE Tariff Lines Share (%)" and include the percentages.

- **AHS MaxRate (%):** This feature denotes the highest tariff rate applied by the country on any product category in the Harmonized System. Create a column for "AHS MaxRate (%)" and include the maximum tariff rates as percentages.

- **AHS MinRate (%):** Similar to the previous feature, this one represents the lowest tariff rate applied by the country on any product category in the Harmonized System. Create a column for "AHS MinRate (%)" and include the minimum tariff rates as percentages.

- **AHS SpecificDuty Imports (US$ Thousand):** This feature indicates the total value of imports subject to specific (fixed) duty rates in thousands of US dollars. Create a column for "AHS SpecificDuty Imports (US$ Thousand)" to include these values.

- **AHS Dutiable Imports (US$ Thousand):** Similar to the previous feature, this one represents the total value of imports subject to duties in thousands of US dollars. Create a column for "AHS Dutiable Imports (US$ Thousand)" to include these values.

- **AHS Duty Free Imports (US$ Thousand):** This feature indicates the total value of imports that are duty-free in thousands of US dollars. Create a column for "AHS Duty Free Imports (US$ Thousand)" to include these values.

- **MFN Simple Average (%):** This feature likely represents the simple average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rate applied by the country. Create a column for "MFN Simple Average (%)" and include the MFN tariff rates as percentages.

- **MFN Weighted Average (%):** Similar to the previous feature, this one represents the weighted average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rate applied by the country. Create a column for "MFN Weighted Average (%)" and include the MFN tariff rates as percentages.

- **MFN Total Tariff Lines:** This feature indicates the total number of tariff lines or product categories for which MFN tariff rates are applied. Create a column for "MFN Total Tariff Lines" and include the numerical count.

- **MFN Dutiable Tariff Lines Share (%):** This feature shows the percentage of MFN tariff lines for which duties are applied. Create a column for "MFN Dutiable Tariff Lines Share (%)" and include the percentages.

- **MFN Duty Free Tariff Lines Share (%):** Similar to the previous feature, this one represents the percentage of MFN tariff lines for which no duties are applied. Create a column for "MFN Duty Free Tariff Lines Share (%)" and include the percentages
